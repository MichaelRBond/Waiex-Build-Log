## Matched holes don't match


While building the structure for the stabilizer i ran across the holes in  SNX-T04-06 and  WIX-T11-6. This seems to be a known issue, from what I've found on the internet.

From what i've seen there are several solutions out there.

1) drill 4 all new holes
2) try to match up the holes, which will enlarge and make the holes sloppy in the rib. Rivet and then drill a could new holes for good measure.
3) order a full length ribs, T04-05 i think, and cut them down and re-drill based off the pattern in the clip.

What is the recommended approach?

Is it OK to have the sloppy holes in the rib? Will that cause any issues down the road?

or, should I just bite the bullet and order a couple of https://www.sonexaircraft.com/eshop/cart.php?target=product&product_id=16271&substring=t04-05 and cut them down?

what is the lead time on that part if that is the best option?
